<p class=>Bands I've Seen is a small application for cataloguing which bands you've seen live at gigs or festivals.
    It was written entirely in Java (the GUI was built using the Swing Framework), with all data stored on a sqlite database.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Record what gigs or festivals you've been to with this convenient application. No installation required, just download the right
    file type for your Operating System and get to work! Details which can be associated with a gig or festival include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who you saw</li>
    <li>How good the performance was</li>
    <li>The date and location of the event</li>
    <li>Who you went with</li>
</ul>
<p>All saved gigs and festivals are then presented in a simple table, allowing you to easily see what has been added to the database.
    In addition to this, it's possble to filter the presented data on citeria such as the date, the location, who you went with, and
    whether the event was a gig or a festival. Results can be sorted by artist name, event date, location, or rating in ascending or
    descending order. It's never been easier to keep track of who you've seen.
</p>

<p>Made a mistake with the details? No problem, all records can be edited from within the application. Change the rating of a performance,
    add more days to a festival, rename a friend, or whatever else you want. Acidentally added a gig twice whilst suffering from a hangover?
    It's possible to delete saved events as well. Don't worry, you'll be asked that you're sure you want to proceed to prevent any mishaps.
</p>
<h2>How to run</h2>
<P>Either download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/Samsquamptch/BandsIveSeen/releases">here</a>, or clone the repository
    from <a href="https://github.com/Samsquamptch/BandsIveSeen/tree/main">here</a> and build the jar yourself. Save the file to a directory and
    double click to run. Running the application for the first time will create a .db file in the same directory. Keep this with the application!</P>
